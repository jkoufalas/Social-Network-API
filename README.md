# Social Network API

## Description

This is an application that interfaces with a MongoDB database using mongoose ODM.
This is the back end implementation of a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list.

There are 3 main tables, Categories, Products and Tags.

- A category can have many Products.
- A Product can have many Tags
- A Tag can be against many Products.

These tables are related to develop a relationship as an e-commerce backend .

Express JS routing is used so that a front end can interface with the back end implementation.
This way the database can be searched, items can be created, updated and deleted and relationships with data in tables created properly in the back end.
The details of the API calls are explained in the Express API Information section.
